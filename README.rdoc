http://github.com/haruska/ninja-decorators

== DESCRIPTION:

Implements before_filter, after_filter, and around_filter decorators
similar to Rails but can be used anywhere

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Currently, only around_filter is implemented. Also, need to change
syntax to :only and :except filters similar to Rails

== SYNOPSIS:

Similar to Rails, the following will execute the method foo around
both the bar and baz methods:

class MyClass
  include NinjaDecorators::ModuleFilters
  
  around_filter :foo, [:bar, :baz]
  
  def bar
    pp "Hello bar"
  end
  
  def baz
    pp "Hello baz"
  end
  
  private
  
  def foo
    pp "Called foo"
    yield
    pp "Finishing foo"
  end
end 

== REQUIREMENTS:
